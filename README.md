In this repo I have recreated the SHA-2 algorithm in python in order to help my understanding of the algorihm's method. The SHA-2 algorithm is a commonly used hashing algorithm.

## IMPORTANT NOTE ##

I am some guy in a room. You should never use the code here for real encryption purposes. I hope it will help you understand the principals of the SHA-2 algorithm but this has not been checked by anyone with any real expertise or training in cryptography.
